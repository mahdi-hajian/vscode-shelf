# Changelog

All notable changes to this extension will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.4] - 2025-12-31

### ✨ Added
- **Diff-aware unshelve conflicts**:
  - New conflict dialog now offers _Apply Shelf Version_, _Keep Current_, or _Mark As Conflict_ options
  - Selecting _Mark As Conflict_ injects git-style markers only around the exact hunks that differ
- **Smarter conflict summaries**: Unshelve toast now reports how many files were applied, skipped, already up-to-date, or marked as conflicts

### 🔧 Technical Changes
- Introduced the `diff` dependency to generate precise line-based conflict hunks
- Refactored unshelve flow to reuse a shared conflict-resolution pipeline for both “Unshelve All” and “Unshelve Selection”

## [0.2.3] - 2025-12-14

### ✨ Added
- **Auto-save feature**: New `shelf.autoSave` configuration option
  - Automatically saves uncommitted changes to shelf when switching git branches
  - Creates shelf entries with descriptive names: `Auto-saved from {source-branch} to {target-branch} ({timestamp})`
  - Uses efficient Git repository state events for branch change detection
  - Falls back to polling mechanism (every 2 seconds) when event-based tracking is unavailable
  - Default value: `false` (disabled by default for backward compatibility)
  - Respects configuration changes without requiring extension restart

### 🔧 Technical Changes
- Added `getCurrentBranch()` utility function in `gitUtils.ts`
- Added `autoShelveChanges()` function in `shelfOperations.ts` for automatic shelf creation
- Implemented branch tracking system with configuration change listener in `extension.ts`
- Added proper cleanup for branch tracking resources on extension deactivation

### 📝 How to Use
1. Open VS Code Settings (Ctrl+, or Cmd+,)
2. Search for `shelf.autoSave`
3. Enable the setting by checking the box or setting it to `true`
4. Your uncommitted changes will now be automatically saved when you switch git branches
